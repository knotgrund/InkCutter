# InkCutter v1.0.2
# Shaun Landis <slandis@gmail.com>
# Based on InkCut v1.0 from Jairus Martin <frmdstryr@gmail.com>

This code is forked from InkCut v1.0, which allowed plotting to various plotters in Inkscape under Linux. Currently, the codebase has been altered to support plotting to Serial plotters under both Linux and Windows, and Generic USB Printers under Linux (/dev/usb/lp*).

This code is driven by the hardware that I own and use. I make no claim that it will work universally for whatever plotter you happen to own. That being the case, printing to CUPS is disabled. If you re-enabled it, you're on your own. The legacy code surrounding CUPS support is currently only left behind for reference.
