# InkCutter

See below for requirements, et all.

This fork is purely for a small functionality upgrade. InkCut development has been stalled for quite some time, and I felt that the issue at hand, while fairly specific, warranted some further exploration.

The Scene:

US Plotter Refine MH871 which, when plugged in via USB to a Linux host, is recognized as a very generic USB printer assigned to /dev/usb/lp0.

Neither the Printer nor Serial configurations in InkCut would see or print to this device (a character device.) The Printer settings used CUPS to search for and utilize printing devices, while the Serial settings want to perform IOCTL's, and set baud rates and parity, etc. Obviously not going to happen on a character device.

Immediately, I tested and was able to simply dump plain-text HPGL files to /dev/usb/lp0, and the plotter would respond in kind. So, on to the simple task. I basically just added a couple new controls in the glade config, and added a section in the python source to check these controls just like the Printer and Serial controls were checked to come up with a device to plot to.

One thing to note: For me at least, using this printer requires CUPS to be disabled, so you'll find in this source that it is so. Check out inkcut/app/main.py to find the commented out section if you're going to use CUPS. As a caution, I'd recommend you also then comment out the usblp-driven code. But, if you were going to do that at this point, you shouldn't be trying my fork of already-working code for that setup.

On to the show!
